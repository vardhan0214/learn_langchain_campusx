Oh, cricket, the game of grace and skill,
A sport that brings us joy and thrills.
From the green fields of England's shore,
To the sun-kissed plains of India's roar,
Cricket has captured hearts and minds,
With its rhythmic swing and spin divine.

The crack of willow on ball in flight,
Echoes through the ages, a wondrous sight.
A game of strategy, of wit and guile,
Where batsmen dance, and bowlers smile.
From the spinners' artful curls,
To the fast men's raw power unfurled,
Cricket is a symphony of skill,
A ballet of athletes, a thrill to fulfill.

The crowd cheers on their heroes with glee,
As runs flow like a river, wild and free.
The wicketkeeper's gloves, so fine and white,
Reflect the sun's rays, a beacon of light.
The stumps stand tall, a test of might,
A challenge to batsmen, day or night.
Cricket is a game of endless charm,
A tale of courage, a story to disarm.

From the early dawn till the evening sun,
Cricket's magic has just begun.
The players hustle, sweat and toil,
As the crowd roars with joy, their spirits soar.
In cricket's embrace, we find our peace,
A respite from life's chaotic ceaselessness.
For in this game of skill and grace,
We find a beauty that transcends the human race.

Oh, cricket, how you bring us joy,
With every swing, a new tale employ.
From the humble village green to the grandest stage,
You unite us all, in your eternal sway.
So here's to cricket, a game divine,
A poetry of motion, a symphony of time.
